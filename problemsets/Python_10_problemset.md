# Python 10 Problem Set -- Classes

#### first draft
#### need to go over this again

1. Create a DNA sequence class that will contain a sequence, its name, and it's organism of origin. Do this by creating an \_\_init\_\_ function.

2. Add in a method that returns the sequence. 

3. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that sets and name, DNA sequence, and organism for a gene.
4. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that gets and prints the sequence.

5. Add in a method that returns the seqeunce name. 
6. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that gets and prints the sequence name.

7. Add in a method that returns the sequence organism.
8. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that gets and prints the sequence organism.

9. Add in a method that caclulates and returns the length of the sequence.
10. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that gets and prints the sequence length.

11. Add in a method that caclulates and returns the nucleotide composition.
12. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that gets and prints the sequence nucleotide composition.

13. Add in a method that caclulates and returns the GC content.
14. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that gets and prints the sequence GC content.

15. Add in a method that returns the sequence record in FASTA format.
16. Write some some lines of code, outside your class that gets and prints the sequence in FASTA format.
