Python 5 Problem Set
===================

1. Write a script to do the following to [Python_05.txt](https://github.com/srobb1/pfb2017/blob/master/files/Python_05.txt)
   - Open and read the contents.  
   - Uppercase each line
   - Print each line to the STDOUT


2. Modifiy the script in the previous problem to write the contents to a new file called "Python_05_uc.txt"


3. Open and print the reverse complement of each sequence in [Python_05.fasta](https://github.com/srobb1/pfb2017/blob/master/files/Python_05.fasta). Make sure to print the output in fasta format including the sequence name and a note in the description that this is the reverse complement. Print to STDOUT and capture the output into a file with a command line redirect '>'.

4. Open the [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) file [Python_05.fastq](https://github.com/srobb1/pfb2017/blob/master/files/Python_05.fastq) and go through each line of the file. Count the number of lines and the number of characters per line.
 
    Have your program report the:
         a. total number of lines
         b. total number of characters
         c. average line length
