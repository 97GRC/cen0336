# Bioinformatics and Useful Tools

Workflows, and approaches
  saving time: assume your data is corrupted
  saving effort: google searches
  
Data
  consistency, corruption, sanity checks
  NGS data generation: illumina, pacbio
  formats - see biopython
  (un)compression
  
Bioinformatics How do I ...?
  filtering sequence data: 
  QC sequence data:
  genome assembly
  sequence search: blast
  alignment: gmap, gsnap, bwa mem,
  resequencing, variant calling
  finding genes
  predicting gene function
  view genes/genomes -> GMOD coming later
  databases store large data for easy searching and retrieval
  public databases
  write web apps
  tell if my code is slow
