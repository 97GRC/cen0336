# Jupyter Notebook

Previously called iPython notebook. An interactive 'lab notebook' for writing code experiments. It stores code and can link to data files and can run the code on the data. Oh, and it looks like a web page and runs inside your web browser, so you can add formatting and images (plots, graphs, diagrams, photos etc).
