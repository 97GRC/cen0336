# Jupyter Notebook

Previously called iPython notebook. An interactive 'lab notebook' for writing code experiments. It stores code and can link to data files and can run the code on the data. Oh, and it looks like a web page and runs inside your web browser, so you can add formatting and images (plots, graphs, diagrams, photos etc).  

You can run a notebook locally (we'll be doing that) or over a network from a server.

The notebooks we'll be running run python (inside a 'kernel'). There are kernels for many languages. The most interesting alternative for bioinformatics is R, a statistical language that has amazing graphing and other analysis tools.

Having your code documented in a notebook means you can rerun it any time and get exactly the same output.  You can also share easily and document what you did clearly. It's perfect for bioinformatics projects.
