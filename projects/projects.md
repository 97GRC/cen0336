## BORATK
### Description
A python wrapper around bwa mem, samtools, picardtools and GATK HaplotypeCaller - this pipeline gets the user from raw reads to raw variants.Aditionally, the students also started to look into variant filtering and QC. The students also got to familiarize themselves with Jupyter notebooks and external libraries such as Matplotlib

## PnP
### Description
You awaken in a dark prison cell without any recollection of how you got there. In order to escape and solve the mystery of your incarceration, you -- the user -- must maneuver to solve riddles, fight creatures, and avoid making bad decisions as you encounter a series of questionable characters in this sassy adventure game.

This project strengthened and broadened the students' Python programming skills via the writing and demo'ing of a text-based (in-terminal) adventure game. The students gained valuable skills in software design and collaborative coding with Git version control.

## WOMBATS
### Description
For this project, several python scripts were developed to parse through peak and gene files outputted from ChIP-Seq, DAP-Seq, and DEseq analysis of RNA-Seq data. The files analyzed included bed, gff, fasta, and excel files. The python scripts created classes or utilized the pandas python package to enhance ease of use.  In addition, the scripts incorporated bedtools and the Python Bio.motifs package to refine peak and gene lists.
