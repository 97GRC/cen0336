# 1. VCF file reformatting and cancer SNP analysis

Find SNPs responsible for cancer drug resistance and reformat associated VCF files

- fastq files aligned to genome
- call SNPs (GATK)
- parse VCF file, add extra information e.g from ClinVar
- SNPeff
- plot distribution of mutation effects

# 2. Annotate genes, search and display in browser

Annotate protein coding genes with predicted functions from GO, Pfam etc

Display genome on jbrowse and enable searching for terms

# 3. RNA seq pipeline with Differential Expression analysis

Create flexible RNAseq pipeline that perfoms differential expression analysis and annotation of genes with significant changes in expression with GO terms allowing for enrichment analysis as well as other statistical tests and/or annotations or predicted functions etc.

Extra: Add multiple analysis and alignment tools and steps

# 4. Introgressed segments in closely-related genomes

Analysis of segments of genes that are likely introgressed from a closely related species that has been in close geographical contact with the first species. 

- whole genome alignments and SNP calling to find long segments that do not have the expected alleles of the rest of the population. Use this as a diagnostic for introgressed segments.
- look for differences in allele frequency

# 5. Code for peak calling and shape comparison in DAP- or ChIP-seq data 

Attempt to categorize and align differently-shaped peaks in data from different timepoints or conditions or species. Invetigate whether it's possible to call a peak as covering the same motif or coordinates even if its shape is very different.

Count numbers of peaks that overlap and don't 

Look for conserved motifs near (up/downstream of or under peaks), particularly around peaks that might have different signals in different samples (differesntial expression)

# 6. Text-based RPG

Collaboratively write a classic-style, text-based role-playing game (RPG).

The user will interact with the game via the game prompt to perform actions and achieve goals for points. Such games usually require decision making by enumerative options provided by the game. The outcomes of some such decisions, (*e.g.*, `A troll approaches you; do you [attack], [offer] him a drink, or [walk] away?`) may not always be deterministic.

Project members will be responsible for planning the storyline and writing the enumerative context-based decision tree to navigate that storyline.
