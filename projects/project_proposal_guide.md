Project Proposal and Presentation Guide
=======================================

A strong project proposal (and project-end presentation) will satisfy the following points:

- Description of problem, biological or other (3-4 sentences)

- Proposed programming solution (3-8 sentences)
    - Overview of features/stages/components to be implemented
    - How the proposed program/software solves the problem
    - Desired inputs/outputs
    - Potential challenges that may be encountered

- Anticipated programming concepts (logic, data structures, modules, algorithms, etc.) to be used in implementing the solution (1-2 sentences for each concept)

In addition to discussing the above points, strong presentations integrate:

- Live demos
- Code walk-throughs/highlights
- Discussion of lessons learned
- Future directions/improvments
